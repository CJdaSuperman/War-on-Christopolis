# War-on-Christopolis
This is the second game I ever made. Technically it's more of a tech demo, but this game was made with Unity Engine. 

It's a rail shooter where the goal is to survive the waves of enemies within a level.

I learned how to make this game through Udemy's Complete C# Unity Developer 3D course. Most of the assets were from the Unity Asset store, a few from the course. The codebase was initially from the course as well, however, I improved and refactored some of the code as Iâ€™ve gotten more experienced over time.

To find the source code for this project, go to Assets->Scripts. I also created a UML class diagram for the project to show how I visualized the scripts behaving with one another. The link provided is the progress I have made so far. https://youtu.be/FL9lm7DEeUg
